Q10) Window focus checker
Write a script that constantly checks which window is currently active and logs the window titles to a text file.
 
; Script to log the titles of currently active windows to a text file
 
; Define the output log file
Global $logFile = @ScriptDir & "\ActiveWindowsLog.txt"
 
; Open the log file for appending
FileWrite($logFile, "--- Active Window Logger Started: " & @YEAR & "/" & @MON & "/" & @MDAY & " " & @HOUR & ":" & @MIN & ":" & @SEC & " ---" & @CRLF)
 
; Variable to store the last window title to avoid duplicate logging
Global $lastTitle = ""
 
While True
    ; Get the handle of the currently active window
    $activeWindowHandle = WinGetHandle("[ACTIVE]")
 
    ; Get the title of the currently active window
    $activeWindowTitle = WinGetTitle($activeWindowHandle)
 
    ; Check if the title has changed and is not empty
    If $activeWindowTitle <> $lastTitle And $activeWindowTitle <> "" Then
        ; Log the new window title with a timestamp
        FileWrite($logFile, @YEAR & "/" & @MON & "/" & @MDAY & " " & @HOUR & ":" & @MIN & ":" & @SEC & " - " & $activeWindowTitle & @CRLF)
 
        ; Update the last title
        $lastTitle = $activeWindowTitle
    EndIf
 
    ; Wait for a short interval before checking again
    Sleep(500)
